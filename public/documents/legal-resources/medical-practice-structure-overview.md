## Introduction

Choosing the right business structure is one of the most important decisions a medical practitioner will make. The structure you choose affects your:

- **Personal liability** for business debts and claims
- **Tax obligations** and planning opportunities
- **Regulatory compliance** requirements
- **Succession planning** options
- **Ability to bring in partners** or sell the practice
- **Asset protection** strategies

This guide provides an overview of the common structures used by medical practices in Australia, along with their key advantages and disadvantages.

---

## Part 1: Understanding Corporate Practice Rules

Before selecting a structure, practitioners must understand the corporate practice rules that apply in their state or territory. These rules exist to ensure that clinical decisions remain independent of commercial interests.

### The General Principle

In most Australian jurisdictions, medical practitioners must not allow a corporation to direct or control their clinical practice. This does not prohibit corporate structures entirely, but does impose certain requirements:

| Jurisdiction | Key Requirements |
|-------------|------------------|
| **New South Wales** | No specific prohibition; standard AHPRA advertising and professional obligations apply |
| **Victoria** | Medical practitioners must maintain clinical independence; corporations cannot employ practitioners to provide medical services (with exceptions) |
| **Queensland** | Less restrictive; corporate practice generally permitted with appropriate governance |
| **Western Australia** | Similar to Victoria; restrictions on corporate employment of practitioners |
| **South Australia** | No specific prohibition; standard professional obligations apply |
| **Tasmania** | No specific prohibition; standard professional obligations apply |
| **ACT** | No specific prohibition; standard professional obligations apply |
| **Northern Territory** | No specific prohibition; standard professional obligations apply |

**Important:** Even where corporate practice is permitted, practitioners must always maintain clinical independence. The Medical Board of Australia's codes and guidelines apply regardless of business structure.

## Part 2: Business Structure Options

### Option 1: Sole Trader

**What it is:** The simplest structure, where you operate as an individual in your own name or under a registered business name.

**How it works:**
- You are the business; there is no separate legal entity
- All income is your personal income
- All liabilities are your personal liabilities
- You have complete control over all business decisions

**Advantages:**
- Simple and inexpensive to establish
- Minimal ongoing compliance requirements
- Complete control over the business
- No requirement to share profits
- Easy to wind up if circumstances change

**Disadvantages:**
- **Unlimited personal liability** — your personal assets (home, savings, investments) are at risk if the business incurs debts or is sued
- All business income taxed at your marginal rate (up to 47% including Medicare levy)
- Limited income-splitting opportunities
- Difficult to bring in partners or sell the business
- Perceived as less established than corporate structures

**Tax treatment:**
- Business income included in your personal tax return
- Business expenses deductible against income
- GST registration required if turnover exceeds $75,000
- Superannuation contributions are voluntary (for yourself)

**Best suited for:**
- Practitioners starting out with limited capital
- Low-risk practices with minimal staff and assets
- Practitioners who value simplicity over tax efficiency
- Locum practitioners or those with portfolio careers

---

### Option 2: Partnership

**What it is:** Two or more practitioners carrying on business together with a view to profit. Governed by state/territory Partnership Acts and a partnership agreement.

**How it works:**
- Partners share profits and losses according to the partnership agreement
- Each partner is jointly and severally liable for partnership debts
- Partners are agents of the partnership and can bind each other
- A partnership is not a separate legal entity (though it can hold property)

**Advantages:**
- Relatively simple to establish
- Shared capital contributions reduce individual financial burden
- Pooled expertise and resources
- Flexibility in profit-sharing arrangements
- Each partner taxed individually (no entity-level tax)

**Disadvantages:**
- **Joint and several liability** — each partner is liable for all partnership debts, even those incurred by other partners
- Potential for disputes between partners
- Partnership may dissolve on death or retirement of a partner (unless agreement provides otherwise)
- All partners bound by actions of other partners
- Limited ability to retain profits in the business

**Tax treatment:**
- Partnership lodges a return but does not pay tax
- Net income (or loss) distributed to partners according to their shares
- Each partner declares their share in their personal return
- Partners taxed at individual marginal rates

**The partnership agreement should address:**
- Capital contributions and ownership percentages
- Profit and loss sharing ratios
- Decision-making processes (day-to-day and major decisions)
- Drawings and distribution policies
- Admission of new partners
- Retirement and exit mechanisms
- Dispute resolution procedures
- Death, disability, and incapacity provisions
- Non-competition and non-solicitation obligations
- Dissolution and winding up

**Best suited for:**
- Two or more practitioners who want to share resources and expenses
- Practices where partners will be actively involved
- Situations where simplicity is preferred over asset protection
- Transitional structures before moving to corporate arrangements

---

### Option 3: Company (Proprietary Limited)

**What it is:** A separate legal entity that can own assets, employ staff, and enter contracts in its own name. Established under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) and regulated by ASIC.

**How it works:**
- The company is a separate legal "person"
- Shareholders own the company; directors manage it
- The company pays tax on its profits at the corporate rate
- Profits can be retained in the company or distributed as dividends

**Advantages:**
- **Limited liability** — shareholders' liability is generally limited to unpaid amounts on shares (though directors can have personal liability in certain circumstances)
- Lower tax rate on business profits (25% for base rate entities)
- Flexibility in profit distribution through dividends
- Easier to bring in new stakeholders or investors
- Perpetual succession (company continues despite changes in shareholders)
- Can accumulate wealth within the company
- Professional image and credibility

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex and expensive to establish and maintain
- Annual compliance obligations (ASIC fees, financial statements, director duties)
- Strict director duties and potential personal liability for directors
- Losses cannot be distributed to shareholders
- Complex rules around loans to shareholders and associates
- Fringe benefits tax implications for employee benefits
- Potential Division 7A issues (loans and payments to shareholders)
- Personal services income (PSI) rules may apply

**Tax treatment:**
- Company tax rate: 25% for base rate entities (aggregated turnover under $50 million and less than 80% passive income)
- Profits can be retained in company or distributed as franked dividends
- Shareholders receive franking credits for tax paid by company
- Personal services income rules may attribute income back to the practitioner

**Corporate practice considerations:**
In jurisdictions with corporate practice restrictions, a company structure may require:
- The practitioner to contract as a consultant to the company (rather than employee)
- Specific governance arrangements to ensure clinical independence
- Compliance with Medical Board guidelines on advertising and business names

**Best suited for:**
- Established practices with significant profits
- Practitioners seeking asset protection
- Practices planning for growth, partners, or eventual sale
- Higher-income practitioners wanting tax deferral opportunities

---

### Option 4: Trust Structures

Trusts are commonly used in medical practice structures for asset protection and tax planning. The most common types are:

#### Discretionary Trust (Family Trust)

**What it is:** A trust where the trustee has discretion to distribute income and capital among a defined class of beneficiaries.

**How it works:**
- A trustee holds assets and conducts business for the benefit of beneficiaries
- The trustee decides how to distribute income each year
- Beneficiaries can include family members, related entities, and charities
- The trust itself does not pay tax (unless income is retained)

**Advantages:**
- Significant income-splitting flexibility
- Asset protection (trust assets are separate from personal assets)
- Capital gains tax concessions available
- Can distribute to beneficiaries in lower tax brackets
- Flexibility to change distributions year to year
- Useful for estate planning and intergenerational wealth transfer

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex to establish and administer
- Trust deed must be carefully drafted
- Trustee has fiduciary duties to beneficiaries
- Access to trust funds can be restricted
- Losses cannot be distributed (quarantined in the trust)
- Potential for family disputes
- State-based trust taxes in some jurisdictions (e.g., Queensland duty on trust acquisitions)

**Tax treatment:**
- Trust net income distributed to beneficiaries is taxed in their hands
- Undistributed income taxed at the top marginal rate (47%)
- Corporate beneficiaries can receive distributions at company tax rate
- Capital gains can be distributed with CGT discount intact

#### Unit Trust

**What it is:** A trust where beneficiaries (unitholders) have fixed entitlements based on the number of units they hold.

**How it works:**
- Beneficiaries hold units (similar to shares in a company)
- Income and capital distributed according to unit holdings
- Less flexibility than discretionary trusts but clearer ownership interests
- Often used where multiple unrelated parties are involved

**Advantages:**
- Clear ownership interests (useful for joint ventures)
- Easier to value interests for buy-sell arrangements
- Can be used to quarantine specific assets or investments

**Disadvantages:**
- Less flexibility than discretionary trusts
- Fixed entitlements limit tax planning opportunities
- More complex than a company for bringing in new stakeholders

---

### Option 5: Service Entity Structure

**What it is:** A hybrid arrangement commonly used by medical practices to separate practice income from service provision. Combines multiple entities working together.

**How it works:**
A typical service entity structure involves:

1. **The practitioner(s)** — either as sole traders or through personal companies/trusts, derive practice income and bill patients
2. **A service entity** (company or trust) — provides administrative services, employs staff, owns equipment, and charges the practitioners a service fee

```

**Advantages:**
- Addresses corporate practice restrictions (practitioner maintains clinical independence)
- Service entity can be owned by family members or discretionary trust
- Service fees can shift income to related parties
- Asset protection (valuable assets held in service entity, separate from practice)
- Flexibility when bringing in new practitioners (they use the service entity)
- Smoother succession planning

**Disadvantages:**
- More complex to establish and maintain
- Service fees must be arm's length (at market rates)
- ATO scrutiny of service entity arrangements
- Multiple entities mean multiple sets of accounts and tax returns
- Must be carefully structured to comply with corporate practice rules

**Critical requirements:**
- **Service fees must be commercial** — the ATO requires fees to reflect what an unrelated party would charge for equivalent services
- **Documentation is essential** — service agreements should clearly specify services, fees, and terms
- **Genuine services must be provided** — the service entity must actually provide the services charged for

## Part 3: Tax Considerations

### Personal Services Income (PSI) Rules

Income is PSI if it is mainly a reward for your personal efforts or skills. PSI rules can limit the tax benefits of operating through a company or trust.

**Key tests to access structure benefits:**
- **Results test** — you are paid to produce a specific result, provide your own equipment, and are liable for defective work
- **Unrelated clients test** — 80%+ of income from clients obtained through offers to the public
- **Employment test** — you employ staff who generate 20%+ of income
- **Business premises test** — you have premises separate from your home and clients

Most medical practitioners operating from a single practice will not satisfy these tests, meaning PSI rules may apply.

**Impact of PSI rules:**
- Income attributed back to the individual
- Cannot split income with family members through a company or trust
- Deductions limited to those an employee could claim

**Strategy:** Properly structuring the practice with genuine business elements (employees, multiple locations, business systems) can help satisfy the PSI tests.

### Comparing Tax Rates (2024-25)

| Structure | Tax Rate | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Individual | 0%–47% | Marginal rates; Medicare levy additional 2% |
| Company (base rate) | 25% | If aggregated turnover < $50M and < 80% passive income |
| Company (standard) | 30% | Otherwise |
| Trust (distributed) | Beneficiary's rate | Income distributed to beneficiaries taxed at their rates |
| Trust (undistributed) | 47% | Trustee taxed at top marginal rate |

### Example Comparison

**Scenario:** Practice generates $400,000 net profit. Practitioner's spouse has no other income.

| Structure | Tax Outcome |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Sole trader** | All income taxed to practitioner. Tax approx. $152,000 (including Medicare levy) |
| **Partnership (50/50 with spouse)** | Each partner declares $200,000. Combined tax approx. $116,000 |
| **Company** | Company tax $100,000. If $150,000 dividend to practitioner and $150,000 to spouse, additional personal tax approx. $66,000. Total approx. $166,000 (but timing flexibility) |
| **Discretionary trust** | Distribute $180,000 to practitioner, $180,000 to spouse, $40,000 to adult child. Total tax approx. $98,000 |

*Note: This is a simplified illustration only. Actual outcomes depend on many factors. Professional tax advice is essential.*

## Part 4: Choosing the Right Structure

### Decision Framework

Consider the following factors when choosing a structure:

| Factor | Questions to Consider |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Risk profile** | What is your exposure to professional negligence claims? Do you have significant personal assets to protect? |
| **Income level** | Is your income high enough to benefit from company tax rates? Can you use income splitting? |
| **Growth plans** | Do you plan to expand, bring in partners, or sell the practice? |
| **Complexity tolerance** | Are you comfortable with administrative burden and compliance costs? |
| **Family situation** | Are there family members who could benefit from income distributions? |
| **Exit strategy** | When and how do you plan to exit the practice? |
| **Asset ownership** | Who should own practice assets (premises, equipment, goodwill)? |

### Common Structures by Practice Stage

| Stage | Common Structure | Rationale |
|-------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Starting out** | Sole trader | Simple, low cost, flexibility to change later |
| **Established (single practitioner)** | Sole trader + service trust | Income splitting, some asset protection |
| **Growing practice** | Company + service trust | Tax planning, asset protection, ready for partners |
| **Multi-practitioner** | Partnership of trusts/companies + service entity | Flexibility, asset protection, succession planning |
| **Large practice** | Corporate structure with multiple entities | Sophisticated tax planning, clear governance, sale-ready |

## Part 5: Implementation Considerations

### Setting Up Your Structure

1. **Obtain professional advice** — engage a lawyer and accountant experienced in medical practice structures
2. **Consider your long-term plans** — structure for where you want to be, not just where you are
3. **Understand the costs** — establishment costs, ongoing compliance costs, and professional fees
4. **Document everything** — trust deeds, company constitutions, service agreements, partnership agreements
5. **Register appropriately** — ABN, TFN, GST, PAYG withholding, business names
6. **Set up proper accounting systems** — separate bank accounts, proper invoicing, regular reconciliation

### Ongoing Compliance

| Structure | Key Compliance Requirements |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Sole trader** | Personal tax return; GST if registered; record keeping |
| **Partnership** | Partnership return; individual partner returns; GST if registered |
| **Company** | Company tax return; ASIC annual review; financial statements; director duties; PAYG |
| **Trust** | Trust tax return; distribution resolutions; TFN withholding compliance |

### Restructuring an Existing Practice

If you have an existing practice and want to change structures:

- **Tax implications** — changing structures can trigger CGT, stamp duty, and GST consequences
- **Medicare** — provider numbers may need updating
- **Contracts** — employment contracts, leases, and supplier agreements may need novation
- **Insurance** — notify insurers of structural changes
- **Patients** — consider communication requirements
- **Timing** — end of financial year is often optimal for transitions

## Part 6: Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I operate my medical practice through a company?**
A: Generally yes, but you must comply with corporate practice rules in your jurisdiction and maintain clinical independence. The structure of the arrangement matters.

**Q: What is the best structure for asset protection?**
A: Discretionary trusts and companies offer better protection than sole traders or partnerships. However, no structure provides complete protection, and personal guarantees often negate structural benefits.

**Q: Can my spouse be involved in the practice structure even if they're not a practitioner?**
A: Yes, but their involvement must be genuine. The ATO scrutinises arrangements where spouses receive income without genuine contribution. Service entities employing non-practitioner family members require particular care.

**Q: When should I restructure my practice?**
A: Consider restructuring when your income reaches a level where tax benefits outweigh compliance costs, when you're bringing in partners, when you're planning for retirement, or when your risk profile changes significantly.

**Q: How much does it cost to set up a proper structure?**
A: Establishment costs vary significantly depending on complexity. A simple company might cost $2,000–$5,000 to establish, while a comprehensive service entity structure with trust deeds and service agreements might cost $10,000–$25,000 or more.

## Key Takeaways

1. **There is no "one size fits all"** — the right structure depends on your individual circumstances, risk profile, and goals

2. **Simple doesn't mean best** — while sole trader is easiest, it offers no asset protection and limited tax planning

3. **Compliance matters** — the ATO actively reviews medical practice structures; cutting corners is not worth the risk

4. **Professional advice is essential** — structuring involves tax, legal, and accounting considerations that require expert guidance

5. **Plan for the future** — choose a structure that can grow with you and facilitate your eventual exit

6. **Document everything** — proper agreements, resolutions, and records are essential for the structure to work as intended
