## Introduction

A well-drafted employment contract is the foundation of a successful employment relationship. For medical practices, employment contracts must navigate a complex regulatory landscape that includes the Fair Work Act, relevant Awards, professional registration requirements, and healthcare-specific obligations.

This guide outlines the essential elements that should be addressed in employment contracts for medical practice staff, including medical practitioners, nurses, allied health professionals, and administrative personnel.

## Part 1: The Legal Framework

### National Employment Standards (NES)

The National Employment Standards provide minimum entitlements for all employees covered by the national workplace relations system. These 11 minimum entitlements cannot be excluded or reduced by contract and include:

1. **Maximum weekly hours** — 38 hours per week plus reasonable additional hours
2. **Requests for flexible working arrangements**
3. **Parental leave and related entitlements** — up to 12 months unpaid leave
4. **Annual leave** — 4 weeks per year (5 weeks for certain shift workers)
5. **Personal/carer's leave and compassionate leave** — 10 days paid personal leave per year
6. **Community service leave** — including jury service
7. **Long service leave** — as per applicable state/territory legislation
8. **Public holidays** — entitlement to be absent on public holidays
9. **Notice of termination and redundancy pay**
10. **Fair Work Information Statement** — must be provided to new employees
11. **Casual Employment Information Statement** — for casual employees

### Relevant Modern Awards

Medical practices must identify which Modern Award(s) cover their employees:

| Employee Type | Likely Award Coverage |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Medical practitioners (employed) | May be Award-free; check specific circumstances |
| Registered nurses | Nurses Award 2020 |
| Enrolled nurses | Nurses Award 2020 |
| Practice managers | Health Professionals and Support Services Award 2020 |
| Receptionists | Health Professionals and Support Services Award 2020 |
| Allied health professionals | Health Professionals and Support Services Award 2020 |
| Cleaning staff | Cleaning Services Award 2020 |

**Important:** Some employees may be Award-free (e.g., practitioners earning above the high-income threshold or those in managerial roles). However, the NES still applies.

---

## Part 2: Essential Contract Terms

### 1. Parties and Position

Clearly identify:
- The legal entity employing the individual (company name and ACN if applicable)
- The employee's full legal name
- Position title and reporting structure
- Location(s) of work
- Commencement date

**Example clause:**
> *The Employer engages the Employee in the position of [Position Title], reporting to the [Reporting Manager/Position]. The Employee's principal place of work will be [Address], though the Employee may be required to work at other locations as reasonably directed.*

### 2. Employment Type

Specify whether the engagement is:
- **Full-time** — ongoing, with guaranteed hours
- **Part-time** — ongoing, with guaranteed hours less than full-time
- **Casual** — no guaranteed hours, with casual loading in lieu of leave entitlements
- **Fixed-term** — for a specified period or project
- **Maximum-term** — with a definite end date but possibility of earlier termination

**Casual employees** must be given the Casual Employment Information Statement and have access to casual conversion rights after 12 months of employment.

### 3. Remuneration and Benefits

Address all components of the remuneration package:

**Base salary or wages:**
- State the annual salary (for salaried employees) or hourly rate
- Confirm whether the rate is inclusive or exclusive of superannuation
- Reference the applicable Award minimum rates

**Superannuation:**
- Confirm the superannuation contribution rate (currently 11.5%, increasing to 12% from 1 July 2025)
- Specify the default fund or employee choice of fund arrangements

**Allowances:**
- Uniform/laundry allowance
- Travel allowances
- Professional development allowances
- On-call allowances

**Salary sacrifice arrangements:**
- Whether available
- Any administrative requirements

**Example clause:**
> *The Employee will be paid a gross annual salary of $[Amount], payable [fortnightly/monthly] in arrears by electronic funds transfer. This salary is inclusive of any applicable Award entitlements. Superannuation contributions will be made in addition to this salary at the rate required by the Superannuation Guarantee legislation.*

### 4. Hours of Work

Specify:
- Ordinary hours of work (e.g., 38 hours per week)
- Spread of hours (e.g., Monday to Friday, 8:00 am to 6:00 pm)
- Overtime arrangements and rates
- On-call and recall provisions
- Time recording requirements

**For medical practitioners:**
- Address after-hours and weekend coverage requirements
- Hospital attendance and on-call arrangements
- Teaching and administrative time

### 5. Leave Entitlements

While the NES provides minimum entitlements, contracts may provide enhanced leave provisions:

**Annual leave:**
- Minimum 4 weeks per year (pro rata for part-time)
- Any additional leave above NES minimum
- Leave loading (if applicable)
- Restrictions on timing of leave
- Leave accrual and carryover policies

**Personal/carer's leave:**
- Minimum 10 days per year
- Evidence requirements
- Additional paid or unpaid leave provisions

**Parental leave:**
- Government-funded Parental Leave Pay
- Any employer-provided paid parental leave
- Return to work arrangements

**Other leave:**
- Study leave and professional development leave
- Conference leave
- Examination leave for registrars
- Sabbatical provisions (for senior practitioners)

### 6. Professional Obligations

For registered health practitioners, include provisions addressing:

**Registration requirements:**
> *The Employee must maintain current registration with AHPRA and the relevant National Board throughout their employment. The Employee must immediately notify the Employer of any change to their registration status, any conditions or undertakings imposed on their registration, or any notifications made to AHPRA concerning them.*

**Professional indemnity insurance:**
> *The Employee must maintain professional indemnity insurance coverage with a minimum of $[Amount] per claim, or be covered by the Employer's professional indemnity insurance policy. Evidence of coverage must be provided upon request.*

**Medicare provider number:**
> *The Employee must obtain and maintain a Medicare provider number for the practice location(s) and use this number only for services provided within the scope of their engagement.*

**Continuing professional development:**
> *The Employee is responsible for meeting all CPD requirements as specified by their relevant National Board. The Employer will provide [specify support, e.g., paid study leave, conference funding].*

### 7. Confidentiality

Medical practice employees have access to highly sensitive patient information. Robust confidentiality provisions are essential:

**Example clause:**
> *The Employee must keep confidential and not disclose to any person (except as required in the proper performance of their duties or as required by law) any Confidential Information. "Confidential Information" includes but is not limited to:*
> - *Patient health information and records*
> - *Practice financial information*
> - *Business strategies and plans*
> - *Staff personal information*
> - *Supplier and contractor arrangements*
> - *Any information designated as confidential by the Employer*
>
> *This obligation continues after the termination of employment.*

### 8. Intellectual Property

Address ownership of intellectual property created during employment:
- Clinical protocols and procedures developed by the employee
- Research and publications
- Educational materials
- Software or systems developed

**Example clause:**
> *All intellectual property created by the Employee in the course of their employment belongs to the Employer. The Employee assigns to the Employer all present and future intellectual property rights in any such materials and agrees to execute any documents necessary to give effect to this assignment.*

### 9. Restraint of Trade

Post-employment restraints may be appropriate for practitioners with patient relationships. However, restraints must be reasonable to be enforceable.

**Key considerations:**
- Geographic scope (reasonable for the practice's catchment area)
- Duration (typically 6–12 months is more likely to be enforceable)
- Scope of restricted activities (distinguish between practice and patient solicitation)
- Cascading provisions to maximise enforceability

**Example structure:**
> *For a period of [12 months/6 months/3 months] after termination, the Employee must not, within [10km/5km/2km] of the Practice:*
> - *Carry on or be engaged in a medical practice*
> - *Solicit or accept patients who were patients of the Practice during the Employee's engagement*
> - *Solicit or entice employees of the Practice to leave their employment*
>
> *Each restriction operates separately and severally. If any restriction is unenforceable, it may be severed without affecting the remaining restrictions.*

**Important:** Restraints must be reasonable in the circumstances. Overly broad restraints risk being entirely unenforceable. Seek legal advice when drafting restraint provisions.

### 10. Termination

Address all termination scenarios:

**Notice of termination:**
| Period of Service | Minimum Notice (NES) |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Up to 1 year | 1 week |
| 1–3 years | 2 weeks |
| 3–5 years | 3 weeks |
| Over 5 years | 4 weeks |
| Over 45 years old with 2+ years service | Add 1 week |

Contracts may provide for longer notice periods, particularly for senior practitioners.

**Payment in lieu of notice:**
> *The Employer may elect to make a payment in lieu of notice, calculated on the Employee's base salary and any applicable allowances.*

**Summary dismissal:**
> *The Employer may terminate the Employee's employment without notice in cases of serious misconduct, which includes but is not limited to:*
> - *Fraud, dishonesty, or theft*
> - *Serious breaches of patient confidentiality*
> - *Conduct causing serious risk to health and safety*
> - *Suspension or cancellation of professional registration*
> - *Conduct justifying summary dismissal at common law*

**Resignation:**
> *The Employee may terminate their employment by giving [notice period] written notice to the Employer.*

**Return of property:**
> *Upon termination, the Employee must immediately return all property of the Employer, including keys, access cards, equipment, patient records, and documents.*

### 11. Policies and Procedures

Incorporate workplace policies by reference:

> *The Employee must comply with the Employer's policies and procedures as varied from time to time. Current policies are available [location/intranet]. Key policies include:*
> - *Code of Conduct*
> - *Privacy and Confidentiality Policy*
> - *Work Health and Safety Policy*
> - *Anti-discrimination and Harassment Policy*
> - *Social Media Policy*
> - *Infection Control Policy*

**Note:** Changes to policies should be communicated to employees. Significant changes to terms and conditions generally require employee consent.

## Part 3: Additional Considerations

### Employee vs Contractor

Correctly characterising the relationship is critical. Misclassifying an employee as a contractor (sham contracting) attracts significant penalties.

**Key indicators of employment:**
- Control over how work is performed
- Integration into the business
- Working set hours at the employer's premises
- Being paid by the hour/salary rather than by result
- Using the employer's equipment
- Not operating an independent business

**Medical practitioner arrangements** require particular care. Many practices engage practitioners as contractors, but this must be properly structured. Seek legal advice on the appropriate arrangement.

### Fixed-Term Contract Limitations

From 6 December 2023, new limitations apply to fixed-term contracts:
- Generally cannot exceed 2 years (including renewals)
- Cannot be renewed more than once
- Must genuinely relate to a time-limited purpose (e.g., parental leave cover, specific project)

### High-Income Guarantee

Employees earning above the high-income threshold ($175,000 from 1 July 2024) may have a "guarantee of annual earnings" which can modify Award coverage. However, the NES still applies, and careful drafting is required.

---

## Part 4: Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Failing to identify Award coverage** — even if paying above Award rates, employees retain Award entitlements unless properly contracted out

2. **Inadequate record-keeping** — maintain time and wage records for 7 years; payslips must be issued within 1 working day of payment

3. **Sham contracting** — misclassifying employees as contractors exposes the practice to back-payment claims, penalties, and prosecution

4. **Unenforceable restraints** — overly broad restraints may be entirely struck out; cascading provisions improve enforceability

5. **Failing to provide required documents** — Fair Work Information Statement must be given to new employees; Casual Employment Information Statement to casuals

6. **Unlawful deductions** — deductions from wages (other than required by law) generally require written authorisation and must primarily benefit the employee

7. **Ignoring modern slavery obligations** — practices with revenue over $100 million must comply with Modern Slavery Act reporting requirements
