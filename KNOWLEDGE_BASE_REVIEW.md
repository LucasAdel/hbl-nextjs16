Restraint of Trade in Medical Practice:

**What is Restraint of Trade?**
Clauses restricting practitioners from:
• Setting up competing practice nearby
• Taking patients when leaving
• Soliciting staff
• Working for competitors

**Enforceability Requirements:**
Restraints must be "reasonable" to be enforceable:

**Factors Courts Consider:**
• Geographic scope (area)
• Duration (time period)
• Activity restricted
• Legitimate interest protected
• Impact on practitioner's livelihood

**Medical Practice Considerations:**
• Patient relationships are personal
• Geographical limits must reflect actual catchment
• Time limits typically 1-2 years maximum
• Must protect legitimate business interest

**Our Restraint Services:**

**For Practices:**
• Draft enforceable restraint clauses
• Review existing agreements
• Advise on breach situations
• Enforcement actions

**For Practitioners:**
• Review restraint obligations before signing
• Advise on restraint implications
• Challenge unreasonable restraints
• Exit planning within restraints

**Common Issues:**
• Restraints that are too broad (unenforceable)
• Restraints that are too narrow (ineffective)
• Unclear definitions of restricted area
• No consideration (restraint added later)

Do you need restraint advice for your situation?

This landmark case significantly impacts medical practice payroll tax compliance:

**Implications for Medical Practices:**
• Contract terms alone don't determine status

#### Response Template

```
**Hollis v Vabu Pty Ltd [2001] HCA 44 - High Court of Australia**

This foundational case establishes the framework for contractor classification:

**Background:**
• High Court examined bicycle courier arrangements
• Established multi-factor test for classification
• Remains cornerstone of contractor law

**Multi-Factor Test Factors:**
1. **Control** - Over how, when, where work performed
2. **Integration** - Part of the business or own enterprise
3. **Economic Reality** - Risk bearing, profit opportunity
4. **Exclusivity** - Ability to work for others
5. **Equipment** - Who provides tools of trade
6. **Presentation** - Uniform, branding requirements

**Application to Medical Practices:**
• Each factor examined in totality
• No single factor determinative
• Practical reality prevails over contract terms
• Subsequent cases (Thomas and Naaz, Optical Superstore) apply these principles

**Current Relevance:**
This case underpins all contractor classification analysis in Australia, including medical practice arrangements.

Would you like to understand how these factors apply to your practitioner arrangements?

#### Response Template

```
Medical practices face what we call the 'Triple Regulatory Contractor Threat':

1. **State Revenue Office** - Payroll tax compliance and audits
2. **Australian Taxation Office** - Income tax and GST obligations
3. **Fair Work Commission** - Employment vs contractor classification

Each regulator has different tests and requirements, creating a complex compliance environment. One misstep can trigger investigations from multiple authorities.

We help practices navigate all three regulatory bodies with comprehensive compliance strategies. Would you like to assess your practice's exposure to these regulatory risks?

**Metadata:**

}
```

#### Response Template

```
Understanding payroll tax risk indicators is crucial for medical practices. Here are the key patterns:

**HIGH-RISK LANGUAGE (Avoid):**
• "Our doctors" → Use "Independent practitioners"
• "Staff doctors" → Use "Tenant doctors"
• "Medical team" → Use "Visiting practitioners"
• "Our practitioners" → Use "Associated practitioners"
• "Staff meetings" → Use "Practitioner forums"
• "Performance reviews" → Use "Quality discussions"

**WHY IT MATTERS:**
These terms can indicate employment relationships to State Revenue Offices, potentially triggering payroll tax liabilities exceeding $250,000.

**COMPLIANCE TIP:**
Review all practice documentation, websites, and communications to ensure compliant language.

Would you like us to review your practice's documentation for risk indicators?

AHPRA Annual Declarations are critical for maintaining your professional registration. Here are the four key requirements:

**1. Self-Employment Status**
Provide clear written confirmation of your independent status when responding to AHPRA enquiries.

**2. Practice Addresses**
Disclose EVERY premises where you practise, including:
• Primary clinics
• Secondary locations
• Telehealth service addresses

**3. Business Names**
Document all business and practice company names under which you operate professionally.

**4. Shared Premises Practitioners**
List full names of all registered health practitioners you share premises with, including any cost-sharing arrangements (even informal ones).

**Why It Matters:**
Incomplete declarations can trigger regulatory issues and must align with your payroll tax documentation.

Would you like help ensuring your AHPRA declarations are complete and compliant?

```

#### Response Template

```
Why Use a Specialised Medical Practice Lawyer:

**The Difference Expertise Makes:**

**General Commercial Lawyer:**
• May miss healthcare-specific regulations
• Unfamiliar with medical practice structures
• Generic templates not fit for purpose
• No relationship with healthcare regulators
• May underestimate compliance risks

**Hamilton Bailey (Specialised):**
• Deep healthcare regulatory knowledge
• Tenant Doctor™ trademark expertise
• Medical practice-specific templates
• Understanding of AHPRA, Medicare, State Revenue
• Track record with medical clients

**What We Know That Generalists Don't:**

1. **Payroll Tax:** How Thomas and Naaz [2022] specifically affects medical practices

2. **Contractor Tests:** Healthcare-specific application of multi-factor tests

3. **AHPRA Requirements:** Annual declaration and compliance requirements

4. **Medicare Compliance:** MBS billing and PBS requirements

5. **Practice Structures:** What works and what doesn't in medical settings

**Client Experiences:**
"Our previous lawyer didn't understand the contractor issues in medical practices. Hamilton Bailey immediately identified the payroll tax risk." - GP Practice Owner

**Partnership Advantage:**
Our Health and Life partnership (1,200+ medical clients) provides integrated legal-accounting expertise.

#### Response Template

```
**Why Waiting Can Be Costly:**

Delaying compliance review seems low-risk, but consider:

**Growing Liability:**
• Payroll tax audits are retrospective (5+ years)
• Each month adds to potential liability
• Interest and penalties compound
• $250,000+ assessments can become $400,000+

**Recent Audit Activity:**
• State Revenue Offices actively targeting medical practices
• Post-Thomas and Naaz [2022] increased scrutiny
• Audit selection is unpredictable
• Once selected, options are limited

**Cost of Delay vs Action:**

**Proactive Review:** $X (investment in compliance)
**Reactive Audit Defence:** 3-5X (fighting assessments)
**Retrospective Assessment:** 10X+ (paying back-tax + penalties)

**What Early Action Provides:**
✓ Identify issues before regulators do
✓ Time to restructure properly
✓ Documentation trail showing good faith
✓ Potential for voluntary disclosure (reduced penalties)
✓ Peace of mind

**Limited Window:**
Regulatory enforcement is increasing. The window for proactive compliance is narrowing.

**Low-Commitment Start:**
A quick risk assessment can identify if you have urgent issues requiring attention, without committing to full restructuring.

Would a brief risk assessment be helpful?

**Accountants and Lawyers: Different Expertise:**

Accountants provide essential services, but legal compliance requires legal expertise.

**What Accountants Do Well:**
✓ Tax return preparation
✓ Financial statements
✓ BAS and GST compliance
✓ Payroll processing
✓ Business advice

**What Requires Legal Expertise:**
✓ Contractor vs employee classification (legal test)
✓ Agreement drafting and review
✓ Regulatory audit defence
✓ Court and tribunal representation
✓ Legal privilege protection

**The Classification Test:**
Determining if someone is a contractor or employee is a **legal** test based on case law (Hollis v Vabu, Thomas and Naaz). Accountants can process either arrangement - but the legal classification decision requires legal expertise.

**Our Health and Life Partnership:**
We work collaboratively with accountants. Our partnership with Health and Life (Australia's leading healthcare accountant) shows how legal and accounting expertise complement each other.

**Ask Your Accountant:**
• "Have you reviewed our contractor arrangements against Thomas and Naaz?"
• "Can you provide legal advice on our payroll tax position?"
• "Will you represent us in a State Revenue audit?"

If they can't, that's where we come in.

**Best Practice:**
Informed accountants appreciate legal input on compliance matters. We're happy to collaborate with your existing accountant.

Would you like us to work alongside your accountant?

I specialise in **medical practice law** and may not be the best resource for that topic.

**Hamilton Bailey focuses on:**
• Medical practice compliance and structuring
• Payroll tax for healthcare businesses
• Practice sales, purchases, and partnerships
• Healthcare regulatory matters
• Commercial agreements for medical practices

**We don't practice in:**
• Criminal law
• Family law
• Immigration
• Personal injury
• General conveyancing

**However**, if your question relates to a medical practice (even tangentially), I'm happy to help!

**Need a referral?**
If you need a lawyer in another area, we can recommend trusted colleagues. Just let us know.

Is there a medical practice legal matter I can assist with instead?

I can provide **general information** about medical practice law, but I cannot give **specific legal advice** tailored to your unique situation.

**Why This Matters:**
• Legal advice must consider all your circumstances
• Your documents, history, and goals affect the advice
