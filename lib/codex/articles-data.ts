# AHPRA Advertising Compliance: What Every Australian Medical Practitioner Must Know in 2025

## Introduction: Understanding the Stakes

As an Australian medical practitioner, your expertise is your currency. Your years of training, your AHPRA registration, and your dedication to patient care speak volumes. However, a single non-compliant statement on your practice website could result in penalties of up to **$60,000**.

The Health Practitioner Regulation National Law was amended in 2022, increasing maximum penalties for advertising breaches from $5,000 to $60,000 for individuals and $120,000 for body corporates. As of July 2024, these penalties apply in all Australian jurisdictions, including Western Australia.

At Hamilton Bailey, we have advised hundreds of medical practitioners on compliance, tax structuring, and practice management. This guide distils the essential AHPRA advertising requirements every practitioner must understand.

## The Five Pillars of AHPRA Advertising Compliance

### 1. The Testimonial Prohibition: Strict Liability

**Section 133(1)(c) creates strict liability for clinical testimonials.**

This is perhaps the most misunderstood—and most consequential—aspect of AHPRA compliance. Unlike other advertising breaches that require intent or negligence, testimonial violations are **strict liability**. This means even inadvertent publication of a clinical testimonial constitutes a breach.

**What constitutes a clinical testimonial?**

Any statement containing these four triggers:

| Trigger | Example | Risk Level |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Symptom | "My chronic back pain..." | Breach |
| Diagnosis | "After being diagnosed with sciatica..." | Breach |
| Treatment | "The spinal manipulation..." | Breach |
| Outcome | "I'm now pain-free..." | Breach |

**What is permitted?**

Non-clinical reviews about operational aspects remain permissible:
- "Friendly and professional staff"
- "Easy parking and accessible location"
- "Appointments run on time"
- "Clean and modern facilities"

**The Platform Responsibility Rule**

If you control a platform (your website, Facebook page, Instagram account), you are responsible for removing clinical testimonials. If you cannot remove them (e.g., Facebook Reviews), you must disable the feature entirely.

For third-party platforms you do not control (Google Reviews, RateMD), you are not responsible—**unless** you interact with the review (share, repost, or comment) to promote your practice.

---

### 2. Language Compliance: Words That Attract Penalties

**Section 133(1)(a) and (d) prohibit false, misleading, or deceptive advertising and creating unreasonable expectations.**

Certain words and phrases are effectively prohibited without substantial scientific evidence:

**Prohibited Terminology**

| Prohibited | Why | Alternative |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| "Cure" | Promises absolute outcome | "Manage" or "treat" |
| "Guaranteed" | No medical outcome is guaranteed | "Evidence-based" |
| "Miracle" | Creates unreasonable expectations | "Effective" |
| "Risk-free" | All procedures carry risk | "Low-risk" with context |
| "Pain-free" | Unless clinically proven | "Minimally invasive" |

**Prohibited Superiority Claims**

| Prohibited | Why | Alternative |
|------------|-----|-------------|
| "Best" | Requires comparative RCT evidence | "Dedicated to" |
| "Leading" | Implies superiority without proof | "Experienced in" |
| "Excellence" | Superiority claim | "Quality care" |
| "Superior" | Requires peer-reviewed evidence | "Comprehensive" |

**What constitutes acceptable evidence?**

AHPRA requires:
- Systematic reviews
- Peer-reviewed randomised controlled trials (RCTs)

**Not acceptable:**
- Before/after studies without controls
- Anecdotal evidence
- Single case studies
- Self-assessment studies
- Studies without human subjects

---

### 3. Title Protection: The "Surgeon" and "Specialist" Rules

**Sections 113-119 and the 2023 amendment (Section 115A) create strict title protections.**

**The "Surgeon" Restriction (2023)**

As of 2023, only medical practitioners holding specialist registration in surgery, obstetrics and gynaecology, or ophthalmology may use the title "surgeon".

**"Cosmetic Surgeon" is prohibited for:**
- General practitioners
- Dermatologists
- Any practitioner without surgical specialist registration

This applies to all advertising including websites, social media, business cards, and clinic signage.

**The "Specialist" Restriction**

Only practitioners with Specialist Registration may use the title "Specialist" in relation to their profession.

**Compliant alternatives:**
- "Substantial experience in paediatrics"
- "Working primarily in women's health"
- "Special interest in chronic disease management"

**The "Dr" Convention**

"Dr" is not a protected title but can be deceptive if it implies medical registration. Non-medical practitioners (chiropractors, osteopaths, psychologists with doctorates) should clearly state their profession:

- **Non-compliant:** "Dr Smith"
- **Compliant:** "Dr Smith (Osteopath)" or "Dr Smith, Chiropractor"

---

### 4. Inducement Compliance: Promotional Restrictions

**Sections 133(1)(b) and (e) regulate offers, discounts, and inducements.**

**The "Free" Requirement**

"Free" means absolutely free. You cannot:
- Recoup the cost through price increases elsewhere
- Bill Medicare for a "free" service
- Require purchase of another service

**Prohibited Urgency Language**

These phrases create artificial urgency that encourages unnecessary treatment:

| Prohibited | AHPRA Concern |
|------------|---------------|
| "Limited time offer" | Artificial urgency |
| "Act now" | Pressure tactic |
| "Don't miss out" | Fear of missing out |
| "Offer expires today" | Time pressure |
| "While stocks last" | Scarcity manipulation |

**Terms and Conditions**

If you do offer any promotion (which we generally advise against), Terms and Conditions must be:
- In plain language
- Easily accessible
- Complete and unambiguous

---

### 5. Legal Disclaimers: Your Compliance Foundation

Every medical practice website should include:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Privacy Policy | APP compliance |
| Terms of Service | Contractual clarity |
| ABN | Business identification |
| AHPRA compliance statement | Demonstrates awareness |
| Emergency number (000) | Public safety |

**ABN Formatting**

Australian Business Numbers should be displayed with spaces in the standard format: XX XXX XXX XXX

---

## Why Reviews Are Not Essential: The Medical Practitioner Advantage

Here is a perspective that many marketing agencies overlook: **as an Australian medical practitioner, social proof, star ratings, and patient testimonials are not essential to your practice success.**

Consider your position:

**You are inherently credentialed.** Your AHPRA registration is a government-verified credential that required years of study, supervised practice, and ongoing professional development. No five-star review carries more weight than "AHPRA Registered Medical Practitioner".

**You are in high demand.** Australia faces ongoing medical workforce shortages. Patients seek you based on your qualifications and availability.

**You are already trusted.** The doctor-patient relationship is built on professional trust, not consumer reviews. Patients choose practitioners based on referrals from other healthcare providers, location, bulk-billing status, and availability.

**You are protected by regulation.** The very regulations that restrict testimonials exist because the medical profession is held to a higher standard. Your compliance with these regulations demonstrates professionalism.

**The bottom line:** Testimonials serve products and services that lack inherent credibility. Your medical registration IS your credibility. Focus on what matters—providing excellent patient care—and let your qualifications speak for themselves.

---

## The TGA Intersection: Prescription Medication Advertising

The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) adds another layer of compliance for prescription medications.

**Absolute prohibition:** Advertising Schedule 4 and Schedule 8 medications to the public.

**Prohibited brand names include:**
- Botox, Dysport (botulinum toxin)
- All prescription medications

**Permitted alternative:** Generic descriptions like "anti-wrinkle injections" (subject to TGA guidelines).

# Payroll Tax for Medical Practitioners in Australia: Complete 2025 Compliance Guide

## Introduction

Payroll tax obligations for medical practitioners have undergone significant transformation across Australia, with state revenue offices implementing new rules, amnesty programs, and compliance requirements that fundamentally affect how medical practices structure their workforce arrangements. The landscape has become particularly complex following recent court decisions and revenue office rulings that have expanded the definition of taxable wages to include payments to contractors in many circumstances.

For medical practice owners and healthcare administrators, understanding these obligations is critical, as retrospective assessments can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars per practitioner. This comprehensive guide examines the current state of payroll tax for medical practitioners across all Australian jurisdictions, providing essential insights for compliance and strategic planning.

## Understanding Payroll Tax Fundamentals

### What Triggers Payroll Tax Obligations?

Payroll tax is a state-based tax on wages paid by employers when their total Australian wages exceed specified thresholds. For medical practices, complexity arises in determining what constitutes "wages" and who qualifies as an "employee" for payroll tax purposes.

> **Critical Risk:** Revenue authorities estimate that tax obligations and retrospective penalties could amount to as much as $500,000 per full-time equivalent GP if a 5-year tax and regulatory clawback is enforced.

### The Expanding Definition of Wages

Traditional employment relationships clearly attract payroll tax. However, recent interpretations have significantly broadened the scope to include:

- Payments to contractors under "relevant contract" provisions
- Service arrangements where practitioners provide services to the medical centre
- Situations where practitioners serve patients on behalf of the practice

## State-by-State Thresholds and Rates

### Current Payroll Tax Thresholds (2024-2025)

Understanding your state's threshold is crucial for compliance:

**Victoria**
- Tax-free threshold: $900,000 (2024-25)
- Increasing to: $1,000,000 (from 1 July 2025)
- Rate: 4.85% (regional rate: 1.2125%)
- Note: Lowest threshold of all states

**South Australia**
- Tax-free threshold: $1,500,000
- Rate: 4.95%
- Small business rate available

**Queensland**
- Tax-free threshold: $1,300,000
- Rate: 4.75% (4.95% for larger employers)
- Regional discount available

**New South Wales**
- Tax-free threshold: $1,200,000
- Rate: 5.45%
- Mental health levy: Additional 0.25%

**Western Australia**
- Tax-free threshold: Varies by size
- Rate: 5.5%
- Different contractor provisions apply

**Tasmania**
- Tax-free threshold: $2,000,000
- Rate: 4.0%
- Highest threshold nationally

**Australian Capital Territory**
- Tax-free threshold: $2,000,000
- Rate: 6.85%
- Amnesty provisions for bulk-billing clinics

**Northern Territory**
- Tax-free threshold: $2,500,000
- Rate: 5.5%
- Highest threshold for standard rate

## The Contractor vs Employee Distinction

### The New "Whole of Relationship Test"

From 26 August 2024, fundamental changes to contractor classification have taken effect:

**Key Changes to Contractor Testing**

The "whole of relationship test" now requires examination of:
- The real substance and practical reality of the relationship
- How the contract is performed in practice (not just written terms)
- The true nature of the working arrangement
- Changes in the relationship since commencement

### Relevant Contract Provisions

Even if practitioners are genuine contractors, payroll tax may still apply under "relevant contract" provisions where:

1. The practitioner provides services to the medical centre
2. Services are provided to patients on behalf of the practice
3. The arrangement furthers the business objectives of the practice
4. The practice exercises control over service delivery

### Critical Factors for Medical Practices

Several court cases have established that medical practitioners typically fall within payroll tax provisions because:

- They serve the needs of the business by serving patients
- The practice often controls appointment scheduling
- Patients view practitioners as part of the medical centre
- Billing and administrative services are provided by the practice

## State-Specific Exemptions and Amnesty Programs

### Victoria: Leading Reform for GP Practices

Victoria has implemented the most comprehensive reforms:

> **Victorian GP Exemption:** From 1 July 2025, wages paid to contractor and employee GPs for fully-funded (bulk-billed) consultations are exempt from payroll tax.

**Key Victorian Provisions:**
- Exemption from prior assessments until 30 June 2025
- Permanent exemption for bulk-billed services from July 2025
- Covers both contractor and employee GPs
- Does not extend to specialists or allied health

### New South Wales: Bulk-Billing Thresholds

NSW has introduced a rebate system linked to bulk-billing rates:

**NSW Rebate Requirements**
- Metropolitan Sydney: Must bulk-bill at least 80% of patient services
- Outside Metropolitan Sydney: Lower threshold of 70% bulk-billing required
- Rebate available from 4 September 2024

### Queensland: Comprehensive Amnesty

Queensland's approach includes:
- Payroll tax amnesty for GP contractor payments until 30 November 2024
- From 1 December 2024, administrative exemption for all GP wages
- Covers both contractors and employees
- No bulk-billing requirement

### South Australia: Transitional Arrangements

South Australian provisions:
- Amnesty for GP contractor payments from 1 July 2018 to 30 June 2024
- Full payroll tax obligations apply from 1 July 2024
- Medical practices must meet all standard requirements
- No ongoing exemptions currently available

### Australian Capital Territory: Bulk-Billing Focus

ACT's unique approach:
- Amnesty for GP practices bulk-billing 65% of patients until 30 June 2025
- Payroll tax liabilities waived until 30 June 2023
- Temporary relief tied to bulk-billing percentages
- Review of permanent arrangements pending

### Western Australia: Different Framework

WA stands apart with:
- No specific medical practice amnesty provisions
- Common law test for contractor determination
- Standard payroll tax rules apply
- Medical practices not impacted by eastern states' arrangements

## Compliance Strategies for Medical Practices

### Immediate Action Steps

**Priority Actions for 2025**
- [ ] Review all practitioner contracts against new "whole of relationship" test
- [ ] Calculate potential payroll tax exposure for contractor payments
- [ ] Assess eligibility for state-specific exemptions or amnesty
- [ ] Document bulk-billing percentages if relevant
- [ ] Register for payroll tax if crossing thresholds

### Structuring Considerations

To optimise payroll tax positions, medical practices should consider:

**1. Service Entity Structures**
- Separate entities for different practitioner types
- Utilise multiple thresholds where permissible
- Consider interstate operations carefully

**2. Contract Documentation**
- Ensure contracts reflect genuine commercial arrangements
- Align written terms with practical operations
- Regular review and updating of agreements

**3. Bulk-Billing Strategies**
- Monitor bulk-billing percentages for exemption eligibility
- Consider targeted bulk-billing to meet thresholds
- Document all bulk-billed services accurately

### Risk Management Framework

Implementing robust risk management includes:

**Financial Protections**
- Provision for potential tax liabilities
- Professional indemnity insurance review
- Regular financial audits
- Cash flow planning for assessments

**Compliance Measures**
- Monthly payroll tax calculations
- Quarterly contract reviews
- Annual structure assessments
- Ongoing professional advice

## Special Considerations for Different Practice Types

### General Practice

GP practices benefit from the most extensive relief measures:
- Multiple state exemptions available
- Bulk-billing linked incentives
- Amnesty provisions in most jurisdictions
- Future exemptions being implemented

### Specialist Medical Practices

Specialists face different challenges:
- Limited exemptions available
- Full payroll tax obligations typically apply
- Higher risk of retrospective assessments
- Need for careful structuring

### Allied Health Practices

Allied health providers must note:
- No specific exemptions in any state
- Standard contractor provisions apply
- Full compliance required
- Consider alternative structures

### Multi-Disciplinary Practices

Complex practices require:
- Segregation of different practitioner types
- Separate tracking for exemption eligibility
- Multiple compliance strategies
- Professional advice essential

## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them

### Documentation Failures

> Many practices fail audits due to inadequate documentation. Maintain comprehensive records of all practitioner arrangements, bulk-billing percentages, and exemption eligibility.

### Misunderstanding Exemptions

Key misconceptions to avoid:
- Assuming all medical practitioners qualify for exemptions
- Believing contractor status automatically avoids payroll tax
- Overlooking the need to apply for amnesty programs
- Failing to monitor ongoing compliance requirements

### Calculation Errors

Common calculation mistakes include:
- Incorrect contractor payment inclusion
- Missing superannuation in wage calculations
- Overlooking fringe benefits
- Errors in multi-state apportionment

## Future Outlook and Preparing for Change

### Anticipated Developments

The payroll tax landscape continues evolving with:
- Potential national harmonisation efforts
- Extended exemptions under consideration
- Technology-driven compliance tools emerging
- Increased audit activity expected

### Strategic Planning

Forward-thinking practices should:

**1. Monitor Legislative Changes**
- Subscribe to revenue office updates
- Engage professional advisors
- Participate in industry consultations

**2. Build Compliance Infrastructure**
- Invest in payroll systems
- Develop internal expertise
- Create audit trails

**3. Consider Long-term Structures**
- Evaluate practice ownership models
- Plan for succession with tax efficiency
- Build scalable compliance systems

## Practical Implementation Guide

### Setting Up Compliance Systems

**Implementation Checklist**

1. **Audit Current Arrangements** - Review all practitioner contracts and payment structures
2. **Calculate Exposure** - Determine potential payroll tax liabilities
3. **Apply for Relief** - Submit amnesty applications where available
4. **Implement Systems** - Establish ongoing compliance procedures

### Working with Revenue Offices

Effective engagement includes:
- Proactive disclosure of uncertainties
- Seeking private rulings for complex arrangements
- Participating in voluntary disclosure programs
- Maintaining open communication channels

## Conclusion

Payroll tax compliance for medical practitioners has become increasingly complex, with significant variations across Australian jurisdictions. The expansion of payroll tax to contractor arrangements, combined with state-specific exemptions and amnesty programs, creates both risks and opportunities for medical practices.

The key to successful compliance lies in understanding your specific obligations, taking advantage of available exemptions, and implementing robust systems to manage ongoing requirements. With potential liabilities reaching hundreds of thousands of dollars per practitioner, the cost of non-compliance far exceeds the investment in proper structures and professional advice.

Medical practices must act swiftly to assess their position, particularly given the time-limited nature of many amnesty provisions. By taking proactive steps now, practices can minimise historical exposures while positioning themselves advantageously for the future regulatory landscape.

Remember that this area of law continues to evolve rapidly. Regular review of your arrangements and staying informed about legislative changes remains essential for maintaining compliance and optimising your payroll tax position.

# Payroll Tax Compliance for Medical Practices: Master Your Obligations

## Introduction

Medical practices across Australia face increasingly complex payroll tax compliance challenges, with recent court decisions and revenue office rulings fundamentally changing how practitioner payments are assessed. The expansion of payroll tax to encompass contractor arrangements, combined with intricate grouping provisions and service entity structures, creates a compliance landscape that demands careful navigation.

This comprehensive guide provides medical practice owners, healthcare executives, and their advisors with essential insights into mastering payroll tax compliance. We examine the critical areas of service entity arrangements, grouping provisions, relevant contract rules, and state-specific requirements that shape your compliance obligations.

## Understanding Relevant Contract Provisions

### The Foundation of Payroll Tax Liability

For medical practices, the "relevant contract" provisions form the cornerstone of payroll tax obligations. These provisions capture arrangements where practitioners may not be employees under common law but are deemed to be for payroll tax purposes.

> **Critical Test:** Two key questions determine if relevant contract provisions apply: (1) Is the contractor providing a service to the medical centre? (2) Is there a payment from the medical centre to the practitioner in relation to the performance of work?

### Typical Arrangements Caught by Payroll Tax

The following common medical practice structure is typically subject to payroll tax:

**Standard Service Fee Arrangement**
1. Medical centre engages practitioners as independent contractors
2. Practitioners pay service fees for rooms and administrative services
3. Centre collects patient fees and Medicare rebates
4. Centre deducts service fee and pays balance to practitioner

⚠️ This arrangement is generally subject to payroll tax

### Key Contract Elements for Review

When assessing contractor arrangements, practices must examine:

- **Control and Direction**: Who determines work hours, rosters, and patient scheduling?
- **Financial Arrangements**: How are patient fees collected and distributed?
- **Leave Entitlements**: Does the contract specify leave provisions?
- **Equipment and Resources**: Who provides clinical equipment and consumables?
- **Business Risk**: Who bears the commercial risk of the practice?

## Service Entity Structures and Compliance

### Understanding Service Entity Arrangements

Many medical practices operate through service entity structures to separate clinical services from business operations. However, recent rulings have imposed strict requirements on these arrangements.

> **New Restrictions:** Patient fees cannot be paid to practitioners via entities, including trusts or companies. Arrangements where funds are held by banks or institutions before payment to practitioners are also excluded from exemptions.

### Compliant Service Entity Models

To maintain compliance while using service entities:

**Permitted Structures**
- ✓ Service entity provides genuine non-clinical services
- ✓ Clear separation of clinical and business functions
- ✓ Direct practitioner-patient relationships maintained
- ✓ Transparent fee arrangements

**Prohibited Arrangements**
- ✗ Patient fees routed through service entities
- ✗ Trust or company receiving practitioner payments
- ✗ Artificial structures to avoid payroll tax
- ✗ Lack of genuine business separation

### Documentation Requirements

Proper documentation is essential for service entity compliance:

1. **Service Agreements**: Clearly define services provided by each entity
2. **Fee Structures**: Document all fee arrangements transparently
3. **Operational Separation**: Maintain distinct business operations
4. **Audit Trails**: Keep comprehensive records of all transactions

## Mastering Grouping Provisions

### The Purpose and Scope of Grouping

Grouping provisions exist to prevent payroll tax avoidance through wage splitting among multiple entities. For medical practices operating through various structures, understanding these provisions is crucial.

**Four Categories of Grouping**

1. **Related Bodies Corporate** - Companies related under Section 50 of the Corporations Act 2001
2. **Common Employees** - Businesses sharing employees between entities
3. **Controlling Interest** - Same person(s) having controlling interest in multiple businesses
4. **Tracing Provisions** - Direct, indirect, or aggregate controlling interests

### Implications of Being Grouped

When entities are grouped for payroll tax:

- **Combined Threshold**: Only one tax-free threshold applies to the entire group
- **Joint Liability**: All group members are jointly and severally liable for payroll tax
- **Australia-wide Wages**: Total wages across all states determine tax rates
- **Reporting Obligations**: Consolidated reporting may be required

### Exclusions from Grouping

The Commissioner has discretion to exclude entities from groups where:

> Businesses are genuinely independent and unconnected with other group members. Medical practices must demonstrate operational independence, separate management, and distinct business purposes to qualify for exclusion.

### Strategic Considerations for Medical Groups

For practices with multiple entities:

1. **Review Corporate Structures**: Assess all related entities and their relationships
2. **Document Independence**: Where seeking exclusion, maintain evidence of independence
3. **Consider Restructuring**: Evaluate whether current structures optimise payroll tax position
4. **Professional Advice**: Engage specialists for complex group arrangements

## State-Specific Exemptions and Compliance

### Current Exemption Landscape (2024-2025)

Each state has implemented different approaches to medical practice payroll tax:

**GP Exemptions by State**

**Victoria**
- Exemption from 1 July 2025 for bulk-billed GP services
- Covers both contractor and employee GPs
- Limited to fully-funded consultations
- Relief for assessments until 30 June 2025

**Queensland**
- Administrative exemption from 1 December 2024
- All GP wages exempt (contractors and employees)
- No bulk-billing requirement
- Amnesty for past periods available

**New South Wales**
- Rebate system based on bulk-billing rates
- Metropolitan Sydney: 80% bulk-billing required
- Regional NSW: 70% bulk-billing required
- Rebate available from 4 September 2024

### Western Australia's Unique Position

WA operates differently from other states:
- Uses "common law" test rather than relevant contract provisions
- Examines totality of contractor relationships
- Service agreements must reflect actual arrangements
- No specific medical practice exemptions announced

## Critical Exemptions to Understand

### 90-Day Exemption

**90-Day Rule**

Practitioners working less than 90 days in a financial year may be exempt:
- Applies per financial year
- Must maintain accurate day records
- Includes all days worked, not just hours
- Documentation critical for compliance

### Services to Public Exemption

This exemption applies where practitioners:
- Ordinarily perform services to the public generally
- Work at multiple locations or facilities
- Maintain independent practice operations
- Can demonstrate genuine public service provision

> **Evidence Required:** Written evidence showing work at multiple locations, hospital privileges, or other practice arrangements is essential to claim this exemption.

## Building a Compliance Framework

### Essential Compliance Steps

**Compliance Action Plan**

1. **Contract Review** - Examine all practitioner agreements for payroll tax triggers
2. **Structure Assessment** - Review service entities and grouping implications
3. **Exemption Analysis** - Identify applicable exemptions and document eligibility
4. **System Implementation** - Establish ongoing compliance and monitoring processes

### Record Keeping Best Practices

Comprehensive records are essential for:

**1. Practitioner Documentation**
- Contracts and service agreements
- Work day records for 90-day exemption
- Evidence of public service provision
- Payment calculations and distributions

**2. Entity Records**
- Corporate structure documentation
- Inter-entity agreements
- Service entity arrangements
- Grouping assessments

**3. Compliance Evidence**
- Bulk-billing percentages
- Exemption applications
- Revenue office correspondence
- Professional advice received

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

Protect your practice through:

**Proactive Measures**
- Regular compliance reviews
- Professional advice engagement
- Voluntary disclosure programs

## Conclusion

Mastering payroll tax compliance for medical practices requires comprehensive understanding of relevant contract provisions, service entity restrictions, grouping rules, and state-specific requirements. The complexity of these obligations, combined with significant financial consequences for non-compliance, demands proactive and professional management.

Success in this area comes from implementing robust compliance frameworks, maintaining meticulous documentation, and staying informed about evolving requirements. Medical practices that invest in proper structures and systems now will be best positioned to navigate current obligations while adapting to future changes.

The key to compliance lies not in avoiding obligations but in understanding and managing them effectively. With appropriate professional guidance and systematic approaches, medical practices can achieve compliance while focusing on their primary mission of delivering quality healthcare.

Remember that payroll tax law continues to evolve rapidly, with states implementing new exemptions and requirements regularly. Continuous monitoring and professional advice remain essential elements of any effective compliance strategy.

## The Specialist Practice Challenge

### Why Specialists Face Greater Risks

Unlike general practices, specialist medical practices receive minimal relief under current payroll tax exemptions. Critical differences include:

**🚨 Limited Exemptions Available**

- No bulk-billing exemptions (most specialists don't bulk-bill)
- Excluded from GP-specific amnesty programs
- Full payroll tax obligations from July 2024 in most states
- Higher average billings triggering larger assessments

**📊 Financial Impact Analysis**

Recent specialist practice assessments reviewed:

| Practice Type | Jurisdiction | Assessment | Penalties |
|--------------|--------------|------------|-----------|
| Cardiology Practice | NSW | $485,000 | $242,000 |
| Radiology Group | VIC | $892,000 | - |
| Surgical Practice | QLD | $567,000 | Practice restructure required |

### The Compliance Imperative

**Critical Reality:** Specialist practices engaging contractors must act immediately to:
- Assess current payroll tax exposure
- Implement compliant structures
- Establish robust documentation
- Monitor ongoing compliance

> **Warning:** State revenue offices are specifically targeting specialist practices due to higher revenue potential and limited exemption eligibility.

---

## Understanding Specialist Practice Structures

### Common Arrangements Under Scrutiny

Revenue authorities examine these typical specialist practice models:

**🏥 Service Fee Model**

The standard arrangement creating payroll tax liability:

| Element | Description | Tax Risk |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Practice collects fees | All patient payments to practice | High |
| Service fee deduction | Practice deducts 30-50% | High |
| Balance to specialist | Net payment after deductions | High |
| Centralised billing | Practice controls all billing | High |

**🔍 Why This Fails:** Creates deemed employment relationship through financial control and integration.

### Problematic Contract Provisions

Specialist agreements often contain these high-risk elements:

**⚠️ Control Indicators**
- Mandatory session allocations
- Required minimum attendance
- Practice-controlled appointment scheduling
- Exclusive service arrangements
- Non-compete restrictions

**💰 Financial Red Flags**
- Guaranteed minimum payments
- Income protection arrangements
- Practice-funded leave provisions
- Equipment and consumables provided
- Marketing at practice expense

---

## The Relevant Contract Analysis

### Two-Part Test for Specialists

Revenue authorities apply this critical test to specialist arrangements:

**Part 1: Service Provision**
> Is the specialist providing services TO the medical practice?

**Part 2: Work-Related Payment**
> Are payments made IN RELATION TO the performance of work?

If both answers are YES, payroll tax likely applies.

### Specialist-Specific Considerations

**🏛️ Case Law Application**

Recent decisions specifically addressing specialists:

| Case | Key Finding | Specialist Impact |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| Thomas & Naaz (2022) | Control creates employment | Session requirements fatal |
| Optical Superstore (2018) | Financial integration key | Service fee models caught |
| Moffet (2020) | Context-specific analysis | Multiple compliance layers |

**📋 Revenue Office Focus Areas**

Authorities specifically examine:
- Theatre/facility access arrangements
- Referral management systems
- Administrative support levels
- Patient relationship ownership
- Professional autonomy indicators

# Telehealth Medicare Billing Compliance: Essential Guide for Australian Medical Practices

## Introduction

The landscape of telehealth Medicare billing has evolved dramatically since 2020, with permanent changes now embedded in Australia's healthcare system. Medical practices face complex compliance requirements when billing for telehealth services, requiring careful navigation of Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) items, professional standards, and regulatory obligations.

This comprehensive guide examines the current requirements for telehealth Medicare billing compliance, providing practical guidance for healthcare providers to ensure accurate billing while maintaining high standards of patient care.

## Understanding Telehealth Medicare Items

### The Evolution of Telehealth in Medicare

The COVID-19 pandemic catalysed the most significant structural reform to Medicare since its inception. Between March and May 2020, the Australian Government introduced 281 new telehealth items on the MBS. In January 2022, 211 of these items were retained permanently, fundamentally changing how healthcare is delivered in Australia.

### Current MBS Telehealth Framework

The Medicare Benefits Schedule now includes permanent telehealth items across multiple healthcare disciplines:

**Eligible Healthcare Providers**
- General Practitioners and medical practitioners
- Specialists and consultant physicians
- Nurse practitioners
- Participating midwives
- Allied health providers
- Dental practitioners (oral and maxillofacial surgery)

## Key Compliance Requirements

### Patient Eligibility Criteria

Understanding patient eligibility is crucial for compliant billing:

**1. Geographic Requirements**
- Patients must be at least 15km by road from the healthcare provider
- Modified Monash Model (MMM) classifications determine eligibility
- Natural disaster declarations create temporary exemptions

**2. Existing Relationship Requirements**
- Many items require an established clinical relationship
- Previous face-to-face consultations may be necessary
- Emergency and urgent care have modified requirements

**3. Clinical Appropriateness**
- Practitioners must assess suitability for telehealth delivery
- Some conditions require in-person examination
- Documentation must support telehealth appropriateness

### Professional Standards and AHPRA Guidelines

The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) implemented revised telehealth guidelines on 1 September 2023, establishing new professional standards:

> Telehealth consultations must meet the same standard of care as in-person consultations "as far as possible" and comply with Good Medical Practice: A Code of Conduct for Doctors in Australia.

**Core Professional Obligations**

1. **Assessment of Appropriateness**
   - Determine if telehealth suits the clinical situation
   - Have procedures to transition to in-person care if needed
   - Document the rationale for telehealth delivery

2. **Technology Requirements**
   - Video consultations preferred over telephone
   - Ensure adequate technology for clinical assessment
   - Maintain patient privacy and data security

3. **Continuity of Care**
   - Telehealth works best within continuing clinical relationships
   - Mix telehealth with in-person consultations where appropriate
   - Maintain comprehensive clinical records

## Billing Compliance Best Practices

### Accurate Item Number Selection

Selecting the correct MBS item number is fundamental to compliance:

### Technology and Privacy Compliance

Selecting appropriate technology platforms is crucial:

**1. Platform Requirements**
- End-to-end encryption
- Australian data hosting preferred
- Compliance with Privacy Act 1988
- Professional indemnity coverage

**2. Patient Privacy Protection**
- Secure patient authentication
- Private consultation environment
- Consent for recording (if applicable)
- Data breach response procedures

## Prescribing via Telehealth

### Current Prescribing Standards

AHPRA's guidelines establish clear prescribing requirements:
- Real-time consultation required (video or telephone)
- No asynchronous prescribing without direct consultation
- Existing therapeutic relationships preferred
- Special restrictions for controlled substances

### Electronic Prescribing Integration

The integration of electronic prescribing with telehealth requires:
- Valid prescriber digital certificates
- Compliant e-prescribing software

2. **Service Inclusions**: What facilities, equipment, and support staff are included
3. **Term and Termination**: Duration of the agreement and exit provisions
4. **Patient Records**: Ownership and access to patient records
5. **Non-compete Clauses**: Restrictions on where you can practice after leaving

## Benefits of Tenant Doctor Arrangements

- Lower startup costs compared to practice ownership
- Shared administrative burden
- Immediate access to established patient base
- Flexibility to focus on clinical work

## Risks to Consider

- Less control over practice operations
- Potential disputes over patient ownership
- Variable income based on fee structure
- Dependence on practice owner decisions

## Legal Considerations

Before signing any tenant doctor agreement, we recommend:

1. Having the agreement reviewed by a lawyer specialising in healthcare law
2. Understanding your obligations under the agreement
3. Negotiating terms that protect your interests
4. Ensuring compliance with AHPRA requirements

## Conclusion

Tenant doctor arrangements can be excellent opportunities for medical practitioners, but proper legal guidance is essential to protect your interests.

# Cybersecurity Legal Requirements for Medical Practices

Medical practices hold some of the most sensitive personal information, making them prime targets for cyber attacks. Understanding and meeting your legal obligations for cybersecurity is essential.

## Legal Framework

### Privacy Act Requirements

The Privacy Act 1988 and Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) require practices to:

- Take reasonable steps to protect personal information
- Implement appropriate security measures
- Prevent unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure
- Destroy or de-identify information when no longer needed

### Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme

Practices must notify the OAIC and affected individuals when:

- There is unauthorised access to or disclosure of personal information
- The breach is likely to result in serious harm
- Remedial action cannot prevent serious harm

## Minimum Security Standards

### Technical Controls

Medical practices should implement:

**Network Security**
- Firewalls and intrusion detection
- Secure Wi-Fi configuration
- Network segmentation
- Regular vulnerability scanning

**Access Controls**
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access permissions
- Regular access reviews
- Strong password policies

**Data Protection**
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure backup systems
- Data loss prevention tools
- Endpoint protection

## Incident Response

When a breach occurs:

1. **Contain**: Isolate affected systems immediately
2. **Assess**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Notify**: Meet notification obligations
4. **Remediate**: Fix vulnerabilities
5. **Review**: Learn and improve

## Conclusion

Cybersecurity is not optional for medical practices—it's a legal obligation. Implementing appropriate security measures protects patients, meets regulatory requirements, and safeguards your practice.

# Medical Practice Partnership Agreements

Partnership arrangements are common in medical practice, but poorly structured partnerships lead to disputes and costly dissolution. Understanding the legal framework is essential before entering any partnership.

## Partnership Structures

### Common Arrangements

Medical practice partnerships can take several forms:

**General Partnership**
- All partners share management responsibilities
- Unlimited liability for all partners
- Shared profits according to agreement
- Common in smaller practices

**Limited Partnership**
- Limited partners have reduced management role
- Limited liability for limited partners
- General partner retains management control

**Incorporated Practice (Company)**
- Limited liability protection
- More complex compliance requirements
- Different tax treatment
- Increasingly popular option

## Essential Agreement Terms

### Profit Sharing

Clear profit-sharing arrangements should address:

- Base salary or drawings
- Profit distribution formula
- Expense allocation
- Capital contribution requirements
- Performance incentives

### Decision Making

Define governance clearly:

- Day-to-day operational decisions
- Major decisions requiring consensus
- Voting mechanisms
- Dispute resolution procedures

## Entry and Exit Provisions

### Departing the Partnership

Exit provisions are critical:

**Voluntary Departure**
- Notice period requirements
- Goodwill valuation methodology
- Patient notification procedures
- Non-compete clause activation

**Death or Incapacity**
- Continuation of partnership
- Buyout from estate
- Insurance funding
- Interim management

## Conclusion

A well-drafted partnership agreement is the foundation of a successful medical practice partnership. Taking time to address all contingencies upfront prevents costly disputes later.

# AHPRA Mandatory Notifications

Mandatory notification requirements place significant obligations on health practitioners and employers. Understanding when and how to make notifications is essential.

## When Notification is Required

### Practitioner Conduct

You must notify AHPRA if you reasonably believe a registered health practitioner has:

**Impairment**
- Physical or mental impairment
- Condition affecting ability to practise
- Impairment placing public at risk

**Intoxication**
- Practising while intoxicated by drugs or alcohol
- Pattern of substance abuse affecting practice

**Significant Departure from Standards**
- Practice significantly below expected standard
- Placing public at substantial risk of harm

**Sexual Misconduct**
- Any sexual conduct with a patient
- Inappropriate sexual behaviour in practice context

## Making a Notification

### What to Include

Notifications should contain:

- Identity of the practitioner concerned
- Specific conduct or behaviour observed
- Dates and circumstances
- Any witnesses or supporting information
- Your contact details and capacity

### How to Submit

Notifications can be made:

- Online via AHPRA portal
- In writing to AHPRA
- Through employer (for employed practitioners)

## Legal Protections

Protections for notifiers include:

- Immunity from civil liability
- Protection from victimisation
- Confidentiality of identity (usually)

## Exceptions

### Treatment Provider Exception

You are not required to notify if:

- You are treating the practitioner
- You form belief through treatment relationship
- Exception applies to treating practitioners only

## Conclusion

Mandatory notification obligations are serious legal requirements. While notification decisions can be difficult, understanding your obligations and the process helps ensure appropriate action.

**Term and Options**
- Initial term length
- Renewal options
- Conditions for exercising options
- Demolition clauses

**Permitted Use**
- Specific medical use clauses
- Ancillary uses
- Restrictions on competitors

### Fitout Considerations

- Landlord vs tenant responsibility
- Fitout approval processes

- Depreciation and ownership

## Common Pitfalls

Avoid these mistakes:

1. Signing without legal review
2. Unclear make-good obligations
3. Inadequate option terms
4. Missing permitted use clauses
5. Unexpected outgoings increases

## Conclusion

Commercial property decisions significantly impact practice viability. Professional legal advice during lease negotiations protects your interests long-term.
